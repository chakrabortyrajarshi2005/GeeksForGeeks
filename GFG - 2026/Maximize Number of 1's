Given a binary array arr[] containing only 0s and 1s and an integer k, you are allowed to flip at most k 0s to 1s. Find the maximum number of consecutive 1's that can be obtained in the array after performing the operation at most k times.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 0, 1], k = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: By flipping the zero at index 1, we get the longest subarray from index 0 to 2 containing all 1’s.
Input: arr[] = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1], k = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: By flipping the zeroes at indices 4 and 6, we get the longest subarray from index 3 to 7 containing all 1’s.
Input: arr[] = [1, 1], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: Since the array is already having the max consecutive 1's, hence we dont need to perform any operation. Hence the answer is 2.
Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
0 ≤ k ≤ arr.size()
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 1

class Solution {
    public int maxOnes(int arr[], int k) {
        int res = 0;

        int start = 0, end = 0;
        int cnt = 0;

        while (end < arr.length) {
            if (arr[end] == 0) cnt++;
            while (cnt > k) {
                if (arr[start] == 0) cnt--;

                start++;
            }

            res = Math.max(res, (end - start + 1));

            end++;
        }

        return res;
    }
}
