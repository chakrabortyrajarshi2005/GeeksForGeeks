Given an array arr[] with non-negative integers representing the height of blocks. If the width of each block is 1, compute how much water can be trapped between the blocks during the rainy season. 

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [3, 0, 1, 0, 4, 0 2]
Output: 10
Explanation: Total water trapped = 0 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 10 units.

Input: arr[] = [3, 0, 2, 0, 4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Total water trapped = 0 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 0 = 7 units.
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: 0
Explanation: We cannot trap water as there is no height bound on both sides.
Input: arr[] = [2, 1, 5, 3, 1, 0, 4]
Output: 9
Explanation: Total water trapped = 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 0 = 9 units.
Constraints:
1 < arr.size() < 105
0 < arr[i] < 103

class Solution {
    public int maxWater(int arr[]) {
        int left = 1;
        int right = arr.length - 2;
        int lMax = arr[left - 1];
        int rMax = arr[right + 1];

        int res = 0;
        while (left <= right) {
            if (rMax <= lMax) {
                res += Math.max(0, rMax - arr[right]);
                rMax = Math.max(rMax, arr[right]);
                right -= 1;
            } else {
                res += Math.max(0, lMax - arr[left]);
                lMax = Math.max(lMax, arr[left]);
                left += 1;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
