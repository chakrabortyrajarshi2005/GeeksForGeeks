The Painter's Partition Problem-II
Difficulty: HardAccuracy: 27.52%Submissions: 171K+Points: 8
Given an array arr[] where each element denotes the length of a board, and an integer k representing the number of painters available. Each painter takes 1 unit of time to paint 1 unit length of a board.

Determine the minimum amount of time required to paint all the boards, under the constraint that each painter can paint only a contiguous sequence of boards (no skipping or splitting allowed).

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [5, 10, 30, 20, 15], k = 3
Output: 35
Explanation: The optimal allocation of boards among 3 painters is - 
Painter 1 → [5, 10] → time = 15
Painter 2 → [30] → time = 30
Painter 3 → [20, 15] → time = 35
Job will be done when all painters finish i.e. at time = max(15, 30, 35) = 35
Input: arr[] = [10, 20, 30, 40], k = 2
Output: 60
Explanation: A valid optimal partition is - 
Painter 1 → [10, 20, 30] → time = 60
Painter 2 → [40] → time = 40
Job will be complete at time = max(60, 40) = 60
Input: arr[] = [100, 200, 300, 400], k = 1
Output: 1000
Explanation: There is only one painter, so the painter must paint all boards sequentially. The total time taken will be the sum of all board lengths, i.e., 100 + 200 + 300 + 400 = 1000.
Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 104
1 ≤ k ≤ 105

class Solution {
    public boolean isPossible(int maxTime, int[] arr, int k) {
        int painters = 1;
        int currSum = 0;

        for (int length : arr) {
            if (length > maxTime) return false;
            if (currSum + length > maxTime) {
                painters++;
                currSum = length;
            }
            else {
                currSum += length;
            }
        }
        return painters <= k;
    }

    public int minTime(int arr[], int k) {
        int low = Arrays.stream(arr).max().getAsInt();
        int high = Arrays.stream(arr).sum();
        int result = high;

        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;
            if (isPossible(mid, arr, k)) {
                result = mid;
                high = mid - 1;
            }
            else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
}
